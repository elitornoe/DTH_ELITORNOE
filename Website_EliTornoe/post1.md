# The Digital Technologies of English
You know the scene, a dark library, dusty tomes from floor to ceiling, beige trenchcoats and pretentious discussions about Shakespeare. <i>English</i> as an academic discipline is so well established you would think it had been bolted to the ground two hundred years ago, as if any modern change was only reluctantly incorporated under duress. I cannot dispute there may be the stray student who would prefer to write their dissertation on a typewriter, but you would be amiss to claim that an English university program is completely void of any virtual technology. 

For this blogpost I want to take my reader through how a degree in <i>English</i> can and do incorporate digital tools and technologies, using personal experience from my years at Aarhus University's Bachelor and Master program in Denmark.

Aarhus University has delineated their English degree program into three primary branches:<sup><a href=https://bachelor.au.dk/engelsk>[1]</a></sup>

1. Literature
2. Linguistics
3. History, Society and Culture

During the Bachelor program every student is required to take classes in all three subjects, giving each student a generalised base, but every student will eventually develop their own specialisation through electives and personal projects. It is difficult to map out universal digital technologies applicable to everyone with an English degree, but I will here try to talk generally about the three branches.

For my own approach, I tend to work within sociolinguistics, with a focus on queer and feminist approaches to examine contemporary discourses, and in particular gendered language. My methods tend to use close readings of online forums or news articles and analysing them in a sociocultural context. I therefore tend to use online spheres for data collection for primary sources.

For the next few sections, I will speak to how Literature and History incorporate digitals tools at a general level and then dive deeper into the specifics of Linguistics and Sociolinguistics as those are the fields I spend the most time with.

## General Digital Technologies

The classic close-reading analysis essay is to this day a tried and true aspect of a degree in English. However while it is an enjoyable task which hones the author's critical thinking and analytical skills, the close-reading essay struggle to justify itself intrinsiclaly in an institution where a product is expected to deliver immediate measureable impact. Therefore, let us talk about how the internet and digital platforms have influenced English Literature and History. 

#### **Research and Access**

The first, and perhaps most obvious, way English has been shaped by digital technologies is how access to research has been made increasingly available. Digitised databases, archives of primary sources, searchable PDFs, knowledge in all shapes and sizes are much more available to the modern student and professor, than prior to the internet.

Physical archives are still vital, and seeing artifacts in person can give a different familiarity with the material, but when it comes to manuscripts, newspapers or pictures for your average student, a digital scan or transcript will serve you perfectly fine.

The sheer amount of data out there does however create a new problem: vetting the quality and relevance of what you find. Furthermore, the upkeep of these digital databases is of course an ongoing and life-long project and we are still limited to what has actually been deemed important enough to keep.

#### **Distant Readings**

Specifically for literature, digital technologies have contributed to a new way of reading and analysing literature often known as "distant readings". These are done by submitting any type of text (i.e. a novel, manuscript, transcript) into programs such as [**Voyant Tools**](https://voyant-tools.org/)<sup>[2]</sup>  which will compare and compile each word. One could use sets like this to examine reoccurring words or phrases, programming it to find positive or negative expressions, revealing patterns in an author’s voice and so forth. The programs can also set the data into infographics to help visualise distinct findings.

If we veer into the more speculative comparative distant readings could perhaps help us solve a common mystery of classic English Literature; was William Shakespeare even the author of all his accredited works or are we actually talking about several playwrights who could be accredited. Large data analysis comparing the authorial voice and language use could perhaps bring us closer to a definitive reveal of just which parts belong to whom (though this is mostly speculation).

#### **Annotation Tools**

Whether you use EndNote, Zotero or any of the many other citation software, your academic efficiency is going to be improved. Typing out a four-page long reference list is possible, but it will eat into the limited time under a deadline. Annotation tools is one of many examples of the humanities adopting digital technologies for the labour intensive-but-low-output tasks.

#### Observation and Data Gathering

## Linguistics
Linguistics has probably been the most effective adopter of digital technologies within the department. The earliest Sociolinguistic research - such as the well know "Social Stratification of (r) in New York Department stores" by William Labov (1966)<sup>[3]</sup> - had to rely on the observer physically writing down what he heard after each utterance. This approach had a significant chance of error and modern recording devices, and digital analytical tools have made it much easier to review the gathered data for detailed analysis.

#### **Accented Speech** 
When analysing and comparing speech, one of the most useful tools available to the linguist today is the spectrogram, a visual representation of the soundwaves of the speech pattern. The spectrogram (seen in the picture above) show voice qualities and the speakers specific articulation. Spectrograms are also used for forensic linguistics as a tool for confirming or rebuffing the identity of a perpetrator of a crime.

Another important part of analysing accented speech is the ability to compare one speaker to another. Digital archives is an invaluable tool to access this type of data, with resources such as the **[Speech Accent Archive](https://accent.gmu.edu/index.php)**, a database of hundreds of individuals recorded delivering the same scripted utterance. It is an incredible resource for comparing differences in accented speech.

#### 
**Transcriptions** Automatic transcriptions of interviews is certainly not exclusive to the field of linguistics. Most researchers who do qualitative or quantitative interviews are probably going to want to spend their time analysing the data rather than transcribing it manually. It is not foolproof technology, and it is advanceable to look through a generated transcript to minimise errors, but it an invaluable tool for better efficiency.

**Digital Communities of Praxis** Finally, another way digital technologies have shaped the field of linguistics is by the explosion of language contact on the internet. The sheer amount of language innovation is difficult to pinpoint, with social media and instant messaging platforms becoming breeding grounds for new phrases, expressions and meaning making. 

The digital linguist can look at things such as the "rules" of texting, the evolving meanings of emojis, how a viral phrase spreads, the social conventions of a meme or how we can decipher the tone of irony through the written word. This type of research could not have happened without the internet, and it reveals much to us on how language contact really works.  

## What have we learned?

So, what does the humanities look like in the digital era we find ourselves in? Firstly, the internet has had a democratising effect on access to knowledge and resources. There are countless online databases available for free use, 

Digital platforms and human behaviour on them have also become a field of study of their own, whether that is social literature - such as fanfiction and collaborative story worlds - or linguistic innovation. The internet is a honeypot of data, both in the classic content analysis way, as well as anthropologically. 

You can certainly still do *English* in the classical way, and in fact you should engange in close-reading and slow analysis if for nothing else, then to keep your brain sharp. But the field as an academic praxis is expanding and effectivising, keeping up with the times and utilise both approaches is necessary for the modern researcher.
