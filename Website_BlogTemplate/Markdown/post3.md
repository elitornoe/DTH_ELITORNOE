# Layout and Design 
I knew pretty early on that I wanted to try to make a website with multiple columns. Taking inspiration from the classic blog style, I wanted a layout with that would display the assignments as different "posts". After some failed tests with the flexbox elements, I searched W3 Schools and found their **[Blog Layout Template](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_blog_layout.asp)** which I used as a base, and then adapted.

The left coloumn features the assignments and reflection as individual "posts", with 'Read More' buttons that pull the content of the Markdown Files. Along with the Markdown File, each post comes with a topical header picture, a title and a "Published" date, mostly there to fit the blog style. 

The second coloumn features a little "About Me" section with a picture and short biography. For this card I wanted to try my hand at formatting the picture to be in-line with the text. It is definitly not the cleanest or most professional looking, but I still think it adds to the style.

The second card in the right coloumn is mostly there for symetry and to be some fun easter-eggs for myself. They are references to some of my personal hobby interests, but written like click-bait headlines to satirise the blog style. Finally, I integrated the Advice API. I did spend quite a bit of time trying to integrate other APIs, but I struggled with their layout and finally opted to use the ones provided by Stephan. 

## Costumisation and Style
Some of the personal costumisation from the template is done with the blog's layout. I limited the width and centered the content, to keep the reading experience more neat and consistent across browsers. 

I also rounded the corners of each blogpost and added additional margins to narrow it even further. 

A fun little detail I incoorporated is with the that when you hover over the buttons the cursor changes to the pointer style. It helps to indicate to the visitor that those are responsive buttons. 

One aspect that challenged me constantly was block and text allignment. Getting things centered was a long drawn out fight. I tried every possible align, center, border and padding command, until I finally looked for the answer on W3 Schools - the result being to set the margins to auto, and a max width.

I wanted the colours to lean into earthy tones, and the pictures have been de-saturated and blured with the filter options to get a so called "Dark Academia" aesthetic. The pictures are all (except for the little avatar of myself) sourced from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/), a free to use stock photo site. The pictures also hint to the content of the "blogpost", such as the lady browsing books in a library, or as for this blog choosing a little "web" based pun.

## Outcome of the Course

I went into this course with very little coding experience. The extent of my expertise was editing .txt files whenever I applied Mods to my Stardew Valley saves. 

The course has definitly given me an opportunity to understand the building blocks of the internet. 

With a level of confidence, I can say that I can now actually "read" HTML, and to a lesser extent CSS. Having gone through W3 Schools gave me a sense of attributes and elements how they interact, an ability I did not possess before. In the early code-along classes I was frustrated, struggeling to decifer one element from another, but as I am writing this, I genuienly feel as if I have a base understanding of the HTML language.

The next step in my coding career will probably be to learn how to make the buttons hide things again; but that will be for another day. Thanks for reading, please let me pass this class <3
