## Generative AI is probably here to stay

When I entered University in 2020 generative AI as we know it now was not even a consideration. During my fourth semester the first image generators - like Midjourney - began to pop up. As we are approaching the end of 2025 and the last semester of my degree, the world of generating written material seems fundamentally changed.

No matter where you head into the professional world, large language models will be a factor, and with how fast these technologies are evolving, it is difficult to imagine what they can do another five years from now. 

In an ideal world, we can muse on the inherent value of the human touch; that we alone possess the spark that make art or writing or any type of creation special. Yet this is not an ideal world, with both profit driven incentives towards higher and more efficient productivity, and plenty of office work that we would rather do without. In this kind of world generative AI is tempting. If we do not see the point of putting in the work, we tend to go the path of least resistance, and I cannot fault anyone for that.

So, if GAI is an existential nightmare to those with humanities degrees, what can we do about it? Lets look at how AI will impact some of our prospecting profesions and discuss how to adapt. 

### Teaching 

If one decides to become a teacher, no matter wether the setting is public school, high school or university, large language modelss will be something to contend with. Much of the point of assigning required reading or constructing an essay is not to have the student learn one particular thing, but to have them practise argumentation, reading between the lines and any number of critical thinking skills. If a student turns to GAI to generate their homework, the entire exercise is effectively null. 

This becomes an issue especially when the purpose is not the content of the homework, but for practising second language skills, which is a path many graduates will turn to in their professional life. Profissiency with a second language does not happen by itself and requires active use of the language - which in the long run can become a real problem in a country like Denmark. Danish citizens are not going to get very far in the world without skills in a second or third language, and I foresee that for the students using LLMs for generating essays can become impeded in to their language abilities.

The next generation of teachers therefore will have to shake the tried teaching methods, and finds ways of practising that will not be as easy to circumvent for students. If Large Language Models are truly here to stay we need to focus our teaching on how and when to use them effectively, while giving them opportunities to practise critical thinking in new ways. Reviewing what the LLM generates can be a way to hone that critical thinking, teach research skills, and hone language proficiency, while simultaneously encouraging to use LLMs as a tool that can be used in some circumstances. More focus on oral proficiency, and in class reading is going to be essential to adapt to the technology without failing the next generation.

### Translation 

The field of translation is another career a student of English can pursue, and it is in many ways also being changed by modern technology. Some translation work, such as the subtitles of tv shows and movies, are already done made by generative AI tools. At this current point in time not all languages are affected equally, the models proficiency depending on the sheer amount of data it has been trained on. 

The level of quality of a translation is also going to depend on the type of product we are discussing. An IKEA essembling manual can likely get away with a few semantic errors, whereas a book translation will want to convey both the literal meaning and the metaphorical emphasis from one language to another. 

Futhermore, translation already had a big eradication scare a decade ago when tools such as Google Translate was made readily available to the public. To this day, Google Translate still struggle when a word contains several meanings, but it has made it easier for people to read an untranslated menu when traveling to a country where you do not speak the language. 

Translation tools are of course getting more advanced, but there is still a difference automatically generated text, and one that has been quality controled by a set of human eyes. LLMs and translation tools can expedite the work, but it is not yet replacing workers completely - simply expediting productivity.

The English Degree program is a bit of an oddball when it comes to future job prospects, because the education is very contingent on what you decide to specialise and work with throughout your degree program. Making sweeping declarations about the future is difficult 

## Vital Digital Technologies 

The English Degree program is a bit of an oddball when it comes to future job prospects, because the education is very contingent on what you decide to specialise and work with throughout your degree program. Making sweeping declarations about the future is difficult, because there is no set path ahead.

However claiming that we are immune to digital changes and technology would be naive. None of us are writing our close reading analysis of shakespear on paper in ink in the candlelight, and to function within the discipline at the bare minimum you need to have an inkling of competency with a computer and a writing software. 

I often find that the English disipline struggles to justify itself against other programs especially in a culture that prioritises constant efficiency and immediate economic gratification. 

Incoorporating more "hard" sciences is something we are actively encouraged to do throughout the degree, wether that is cognitive linguistics (Professor Ken Ramshøj), or recording the heartrates of participants as they consume horror media (Professor Matthias Clasen)

Idealistically, and out of principle, I wish this justification was not necessary, and when I discuss the topic with my peers, we tend to value the degree intrinsically. But we also know that not everyone holds these values, and so we struggle against expectations of tangible and measurable impact.
 
English is not immune to change, and change should be encouraged. The idealist in me wants the change to come from within, an "organic" expansions where the incoorporation of digital tools is encouraged but not prescribed and enforced because of an arbitrary and culturally subscribed value judgement.
